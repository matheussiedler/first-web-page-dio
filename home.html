        <p>The history of computers can be traced back thousands of years to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus" target="_blank" rel="external">abacus</a>, one of the earliest known calculating devices. In the 17th century, <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong> invented the mechanical calculator, which could perform addition and subtraction. In the 19th century, <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> designed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine#:~:text=The%20analytical%20engine%20was%20a,for%20a%20simpler%20mechanical%20calculator." target="_blank" rel="external">Analytical Engine</a>, which was a mechanical computer that could perform any mathematical operation. However, the Analytical Engine was never built due to technological limitations.</p>

        <h2 id="web-history">Web History</h2>
        
        <p>The history of the web starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank" rel="external">ARPANET</a> can be traced back to the early 1960s, when the <strong>US Department of Defense</strong> developed ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) to connect computers at research institutions across the country. <strong>ARPANET was the first wide-area packet-switched network</strong>, and it laid the foundation for the modern internet.</p>

        <p>In the late 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" rel="external">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <strong>a computer scientist at CERN</strong>, was looking for a way to make it easier for scientists to share information with each other. He developed a system of <strong>hypertext documents</strong> that could be linked together and accessed over the internet. This system, which he called the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, was based on the technologies that had been developed for ARPANET.</p>

        <h2 id="clients-servers">What are Clients and Servers?</h2>

        <p>In the internet world, <strong>a client is a user or device that requests a service from a server</strong>. The server is a computer program that provides the requested service.</p>

        <figure>
            <img style="width: 400px;" src="images/client-server.jpg" alt="Image that illustrates the client and server sides working together via the Internet.">
            <figcaption>Fig14. - Image from <a class="special-link" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/modern-web-hosting-concept_3279008.htm#query=computer%20request%20to%20server&position=26&from_view=search&track=ais" target="_blank" rel="external">Freepik</a>.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>For example, when you use a web browser to visit a website, <strong>the web browser is the client and the web server is the server</strong>. The web browser requests the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website from the web server. The web server then sends these files to the web browser, which displays the website to you.</p>

        <p>Other examples of clients and servers on the internet include:</p>

        <ul class="normal-list">
            <li>Email clients and email servers</li>
            <li>File transfer clients and file servers</li>
            <li>Chat clients and chat servers</li>
            <li>Video game clients and video game servers</li>
            <li>Cloud computing clients and cloud computing servers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Clients can be implemented in a variety of ways. They can be software programs, such as a web browser or email client, or they can be hardware devices, such as a smartphone or tablet.</p>

        <p>Clients are an essential part of the internet. They allow users to access and use the vast array of services that are available on the internet.</p>

        <h2 id="html">What does the basic structure of HTML look like?</h2>
        
        <p>The basic structure of HTML is as follows:</p>

        <section class="code">
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My HTML Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        </section>

        <p>The <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> declaration at the beginning of the document tells the browser that the document is an HTML document. The <span>&lt;html&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/html&gt;</span> tags enclose the entire HTML document. The <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span> tags contain information about the document, such as the title. The <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span> tags contain the content of the document, such as text, images, and links.</p>

        <p><strong>HTML elements</strong> are used to define <strong>the content and structure of a web page</strong>. Elements are defined by <strong>start tags</strong> and <strong>end tags</strong>. The content of an element goes between the start and end tags.</p>
